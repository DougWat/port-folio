              <p>I've always had a soft spot for music games that let you supply the music. At the same time, I was interested in experimenting with waveform analysis. I decided on Javascript with Phaser as my language of choice to make it easier for users to access. With a webgame, the user only needs a compatible browser.</p>

            <h2>A Baseline</h2>
            <div class="text-block">
              <p>The backend of the game was designed with rapid iteration in mind. Using a bit of polymorphism and prototype inheritance I can add new weapons and enemies quickly. All base functions can be overridden allowing for unique effects.</p>

            <div class="text-block">
              <p>The game is simple but the fun is there. It's not perfect, but the foundation is steady enough to build off of. The next steps would be to tweak the basic gameplay, add more ways the music can affect the game, and look into deeper waveform analysis. I'll probably need to pick up a book about digital music and waveforms because that stuff is really involved.</p>
