              <p>I've always had a soft spot for music games that let you supply the music. At the same time, I was interested in experimenting with waveform analysis. I decided on Javascript with Phaser as my language of choice to make it easier for users to access. With a webgame, the user only needs a compatible browser.</p>

            <h2>Scalability</h2>
            <div class="text-block">
              <p>Shooty Game takes advantage of Javascript's prototype system. Each enemy and weapon type are based off of one object, which can be spawned and updated the same way, regardless of the specific weapon. This makes it trivial to create new, interesting weapons with unique effects, without having to make any changes to the foundation.</p>

              <h2>The Music</h2>
              <div class="text-block">
                <p>Shooty Game uses the HTML Audio API to handle loading and processing of audio. The audio information is hooked directly into the core gameplay loop, allowing the game to respond to different element of the audio in different ways.</p>

            <h2>What Comes Next?</h2>
            <div class="text-block">
              <p>The game is simple but the fun is there. It's not perfect, but the foundation is steady enough to build off of. The next steps would be to tweak the basic gameplay, add more ways the music can affect the game, and look into deeper waveform analysis. I'll probably need to pick up a book about digital music and waveforms because that stuff is really involved.</p>
