              <p>I worked alongside friends Aaron Sky, Richard Weiss, and Stephen Garabedian to create a web-based competitive typing game. The game is designed for 2-4 players, and should be played with only one keyboard.</p>
              <p>I dealt with making the game work visually by designing and programming the user interface. From small things like a visually appealing spinning timer, to more significant things like the overall conveyance of information.</p>

              <p>This game was conceptualized, drawn out, and programmed over the span of just a few days. Rolls were dealt based on strengths, with my personal interest falling into the technical visual side of things.</p>
               <p>Good conveyance of information is invaluable for a game like this, so I worked to design systems that are attractive, but do not distract.</p>
