              <p>I worked alongside friends Aaron Sky, Richard Weiss, and Stephen Garabedian to create a web-based competitive typing game. The game is designed for 2-4 players, and should be played with only one keyboard.</p>

              <p>I dealt with making the game work visually by designing and programming the user interface. From small things like a visually appealing spinning timer, to more significant things like the overall conveyance of information during the game were my contribution.</p>
