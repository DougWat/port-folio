            <p>The job of a DM is difficult. There are so many variables to keep track of, so many stats to manage, and it all has to be done in the presence of an audience.</p>
            <p>While there already are applications that digitalize D&D, many of them are exhaustive and complicated, with robust interfaces and less than steller UX.</p>
            <p>Delve aims to simplify that, creating an environment that allows for quick access to player information as a supplement to the Pen-and-Paper D&D experience.</p>

            <h2>The Stack</h2>
          <div class="text-block">
            <p>Delve uses a growing selection of the latest web development libraries, frameworks, and APIs.</p>
            <p><b>SASS</b> preprocessor is used to its fullest capabilities to produce readable, reusable, and easily editable CSS. In turn, the HTML is made readable by eliminating the need to overuse classes.</p>
            <p><b>NodeJS</b> simplifies the programming process by unifying the front-end and back-end languages.</p>
            <p><b>RethinkDB</b> was chosen as an alternative to the popular MongoDB for its changefeed functionality. Data will be constantly updated in Delve, so anything that allows the server to listen for database changes is invaluble.</p>

          <h2>Simplicity Works Best</h2>
          <div class="text-block">
            <p>A DM already has so much on their plate, Delve wants to lighten that load. With Delve, a DM can get at-a-glance readouts of every player's stats, and player's can get real-time updates on their vitals, straight from their phones, tablets, or laptops.</p>
            <p>This works ontop of a Discord inspired quick registration system, that allows a DM to create a group, invite their players, and build characters in less than 5 minutes. Delve enhances pen-and-paper D&D instead of replacing it.</p>

          <h3>Ease Of Access</h3>
          <div class="text-block">
              <p>New users need to be able to sign up quickly and add characters even quicker. No DM wants to wait for their players to figure out an application when they could just start playing their game.</p>

          <h3>Non Distruptive</h3>
          <div class="text-block">
              <p>Delve should not take player attention away from the game any more than a character-sheet does. It should encourage less sheet-scanning downtime by outlining all essential character information to the player or DM at a moment's glance.</p>

          <h3>Suplemental</h3>
          <div class="text-block">
              <p>Delve needs to add value to pre-existing D&D campaigns. It should act as a way for the DM to interface more effectivly with their players, without removing the in-person element. It needs to be adaptable, helpful, and most importantly, optional.</p>
